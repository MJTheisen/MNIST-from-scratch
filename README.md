After finishing this most recent project based on the youtube video, I found that the process of Machine Learning 
is similar to how we used it in our Bioinformatics class while running algorithms to find similarities in gene 
expressions. However, there are many more parts of the process that are different that I needed to learn in order
to finish this project. All in all, I will say that it was a fun process that took my Spring Break to start and 
finish, but I learned a lot in the process.
